### Jmals Bakery

**Description**<br>
this is a game I made in highschool my junior year, I wanted to apply what I was learning about 
javascript, html, and css

***How to play***<br>
this game is a standard clicker game where you need to ake enough cupcakes to feed hungry custumors. 
after you get enough money you will unlock many upgrades that will help you make jmals bakery a true powerhouse.
more employees means more cupcakes per click and the auto oven will make cupakes make themselves.
once you get a mechanic on board he can upgrade your auto-oven whenever you wish for the low low price of $5,000
